Collects anything stored to files in a directory. Now it can do with temperatures.

Simple usage:

$ ghci Readers.hs Helpers.hs

> :m +Data.List Helpers
> a <- getMeasurements tempOut "/home/joell/projektit/ahma/measurements"
> printBeautifully $ sort a

If you don't mind some parsing errors (because of CRC errors etc.) you
may put tempOut{relaxed=True} instead of tempOut.
